## Code-blooded Mobile Application </h1>


A one-stop-shop app for software engineering job seekers to help them prepare for their technical interviews.

---

Driven by the struggle of technical online assessments and coding interviews within the tech industry, we came up with the project: “Ace your Tech Interview” planner. This is a mobile application that aims at helping students and recent graduates better prepare for landing a job in the field of technology, such as software engineering or software development roles. 

Upon prompting users for their availability, “Ace your Tech Interview” planner builds a customized preparation plan outlining the data structures topics to be covered based on the user’s competence with each topic. It supports built-in reminders and notifications, a to-do checklist, and a progress dashboard. 



## Future enhancements

Possible extension features for this app include a mock interview scheduler and an application status tracker, where users can log their outstanding applications with companies and indicate whether they’re at the application review, online assessment, or interview stage. Further down the line, the app can also include technical questions relevant to the assigned data structures topics in integration with platforms such as Leetcode and Algoexpert that help individuals enhance their coding skills (see https://leetcode.com/, https://www.algoexpert.io/).
